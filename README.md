*What Is Deep Learning?*
Deep learning uses artificial neural networks to perform sophisticated computations on large amounts of data. It is a type of machine learning that works based on the structure and function of the human brain. 
Deep learning algorithms train machines by learning from examples. Industries such as health care, eCommerce, entertainment, and advertising commonly use deep learning.

Defining Neural Networks
A neural network is structured like the human brain and consists of artificial neurons, also known as nodes. These nodes are stacked next to each other in three layers:
â€¢	The input layer 
â€¢	The hidden layer(s)
â€¢	The output layer
 
Data provides each node with information in the form of inputs. The node multiplies the inputs with random weights, calculates them, and adds a bias. Finally, nonlinear functions, also known as activation functions, are applied to determine which neuron to fire.

1. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
CNNs are a deep learning algorithm that processes structured grid data like images. They have succeeded in image classification, object detection, and face recognition tasks.

How it Works
Convolutional Layer: This layer applies a set of filters (kernels) to the input image, where each filter slides (convolves) across the image to produce a feature map. This helps detect various features such as edges, textures, and patterns.
Pooling Layer: This layer reduces the dimensionality of the feature maps while retaining the most essential information. Common types include max pooling and average pooling.
Fully Connected Layer: After several convolutional and pooling layers, the output is flattened and fed into one or more fully connected (dense) layers, culminating in the output layer that makes the final classification or prediction.

2. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)
RNNs are designed to recognize patterns in data sequences, such as time series or natural language. They maintain a hidden state that captures information about previous inputs.

How it Works
Hidden State: At each time step, the hidden state is updated based on the current input and the previous hidden state. This allows the network to maintain a memory of past inputs.
Output: The hidden state generates an output at each time step. The network is trained using backpropagation through time (BPTT) to minimize prediction error.

3. Long Short-Term Memory Networks (LSTMs)
LSTMs are a special kind of RNN capable of learning long-term dependencies. They are designed to avoid the long-term dependency problem, making them more effective for tasks like speech recognition and time series prediction.

How it Works
Cell State: LSTMs have a cell state that runs through the entire sequence and can carry information across many steps.
Gates: Three gates (input, forget, and output) control the flow of information:
Input Gate: Determines which information from the current input should be updated in the cell state.
Forget Gate: Decides what information should be discarded from the cell state.
Output Gate: Controls the information that should be outputted based on the cell state.


4. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)
GANs generate realistic data by training two neural networks in a competitive setting. They have been used to create realistic images, videos, and audio.

How it Works
Generator Network: Creates fake data from random noise.
Discriminator Network: Evaluates the authenticity of the data, distinguishing between real and fake data.
Training Process: The generator and discriminator are trained simultaneously. The generator tries to fool the discriminator by producing better fake data, while the discriminator tries to get better at detecting counterfeit data. This adversarial process leads to the generator producing increasingly realistic data.

5. Transformer Networks
Transformers are the backbone of many modern NLP models. They process input data using self-attention, allowing for parallelization and improved handling of long-range dependencies.

How it Works
Self-Attention Mechanism: This mechanism computes the importance of each part of the input relative to every other part, enabling the model to weigh the significance of different words in a sentence differently.
Positional Encoding: Adds information about the position of words in the sequence since self-attention doesn't inherently capture sequence order.
Encoder-Decoder Architecture: Consists of an encoder that processes the input sequence and a decoder that generates the output sequence. Each consists of multiple layers of self-attention and feed-forward networks.
